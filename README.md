ReWise – Smart Study Scheduler

ReWise is a full-stack web application that helps students manage their studies using smart revision scheduling.
The idea is simple: don’t just study once — revise at the right time so you actually remember it.

This project was built to understand real-world full-stack development, deployment, and authentication flow.

 Why I Built This

Many students study topics once and forget them later.
I wanted to build something that helps with revision timing, not just note-taking.

This project helped me learn:

How frontend and backend actually connect in production

CORS issues and real deployment bugs

MongoDB Atlas setup and cloud database handling

Hosting frontend and backend separately

Debugging real-world errors (not tutorial ones)
